# `canbench`

`canbench` is a tool for benchmarking canisters on the Internet Computer.

## Background

Canister smart contracts on the Internet Computer consume compute and memory resources, both which are finite.
Resource consumption is measured in __instructions__.
A single message execution has a finite number of instructions to use, otherwise it's terminated.
`canbench` provides developers the tools and insights to understand how their code impacts the canister's use of instructions and memory.
